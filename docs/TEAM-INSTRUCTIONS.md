# LexiConnect – Team Instructions (Short)

## 1. Git Workflow

- Main branches:
  - `main` → final, stable code
  - `dev` → integration branch (everyone merges here)
- Personal feature branches (one per member):
  - `feature-thenu-booking`
  - `feature-chapa-search`
  - `feature-meths-documents`
  - `feature-vithana-scheduling`
  - `feature-udavi-kyc`

### How each member works

1. Clone the repo (once):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/S-W-Development-Group-Project-UOG-4-7/LexiConnect.git
   cd LexiConnect
